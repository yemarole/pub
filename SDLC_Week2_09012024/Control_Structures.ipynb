This helps in understanding the evolution of the codebase and reverting to previous versions if needed.\n",

Developers can work simultaneously on different aspects of the project without worrying about conflicts or overwriting each other's changes. VCS provides features like branching and merging, allowing developers to work on isolated features or fixes and merge them back into the main codebase effortlessly.\n",

This historical record serves as a valuable resource for understanding the rationale behind certain decisions, tracking the progression of features, and identifying the source of bugs or issues. It also facilitates compliance with regulatory requirements and audit processes."
